## Technical Architecture
5. What is the current workflow and data flow of your solution?
6. What data sources are you integrating and in what formats?
7. What is the processing pipeline from data ingestion to final output?
8. What LLM(s) are you currently using or planning to use?
9. Are you using the LLM as a service or deploying your own model?
10. What specific tasks is the LLM performing in your solution? (summarization, classification, generation, etc.)
11. Are you using RAG, fine-tuning, or other approaches to customize the LLM output?
12. What is your expected throughput (data volume per day/hour)?

## Development and Deployment
13. What development tools or frameworks are you currently using? (Prompt flow, Azure ML, etc.)
14. Do you have CI/CD pipelines in place for deployment?
15. How are you managing version control for models and prompts?
16. What is your release process for new versions of your solution?

## Evaluation and Monitoring
17. How do you currently evaluate your model's performance?
18. Do you have golden datasets or benchmarks for offline evaluation?
19. What metrics are you tracking for model performance?
20. How do you implement human-in-the-loop feedback?
21. What tools are you using for monitoring and logging?
22. Do you have evaluation pipelines for each component of your system?
23. Do you have alert systems in place for performance degradation or failures?

## Data Management
24. How are you handling data ingestion (event-based, scheduled, etc.)?
25. How are you storing and indexing your data?
26. What is your approach to vector embeddings and search?
27. What data security classifications apply to your data?
28. Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements for your data?

## Infrastructure and Security
29. What are your infrastructure requirements (V-net, confidentiality, etc.)?
30. Are you using Azure AI Search or other search technologies?
31. What database solutions are you currently using or planning to use?
32. Do you have specific security requirements for your solution?
33. How are you handling authentication and authorization?

## Operational Requirements
34. What is your expected uptime/availability requirement?
35. Do you have specific latency requirements for your solution?
36. How will you handle model updates and retraining?
37. What is your budget for compute and storage resources?

## Integration Requirements
38. What systems will your solution need to integrate with?
39. Do you need API endpoints for other applications to access your solution?
40. Are there UI/UX requirements for your solution?

## Additional Considerations
41. Are there any specific components or services you need from the LLMOps platform?
42. Do you have any concerns about model safety, fairness, or bias?
43. What are your plans for scaling the solution in the future?
44. Are there any limitations or challenges you're currently facing?

## Collaboration
45. Who are the key technical contacts for this use case?
46. Would you be willing to participate in future design discussions for the LLMOps platform?
47. What timeline are you working with for implementing this solution?

This questionnaire should provide a comprehensive framework for gathering requirements across different LLMOps use cases. It covers technical, operational, security, and strategic aspects that would be important for building a unified LLMOps platform.
